Question i
(1) 
	Which would you rather use if you are designing a system: TREND or English? Why?

	-I prefer designing a system using TREND, as TREND stores data and it's state over
	 time and in designing a system consistency in information is of importance and 
	 TREND ensures consistency.
(2)
	To understand someone elseâ€™s data, which would you rather be given: TREND or English? Why?

	-English is high level language and thus reading and understanding someone's data is very simple 
	 and in this form data can be easily manipulated to any data model.

(3)
 	How clear is the distinction between DEV and DEX?

 	 -OK but takes some time getting used to

(4)
	How clear would it be using TRAN(transform) instead of DEV, & ALSO instead of DEX?
	
	 -OK but takes some time getting used to

(5)
	Can you suggest better words to use instead of DEV and DEX? 
	
	 -DEX to continual entity
	 -DEV to volatile entity


(6)
 	How clear is the distinction between past (-) and future transitions? 
	
	 -fairly clear

(7)
	Which direction do you think DEV- (or DEX-) arrows should go
	
	 -as they are now
