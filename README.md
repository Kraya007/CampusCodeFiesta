# JavaCompesation
This repository is for the purpose of relearning java outside of school and cover content that I didn't understand during my years in varsity by solving problems using java,
I will choose problems from books, institutions, friends and sometimes come with my own problem to solve.
Some of the problems will be from the University of Cape Town, Computer Science department, for my solutions to these problems I don't give 
you the right to copy and paste my solution or even a line of code to your assignment but I give you the right to study the solution
so to gain an end in mind to your coding assignment, thus I won't be liable for any plagiarism consequences.
