# JavaCompensation
repository holds various coding experiments and projects from my university days.
most of the problems will be from the University of Cape Town, Computer Science department and applied mathematics, for my solutions to these problems I don't give 
you the right to copy and paste my solution or even a line of code to your assignment but I give you the right to study the solution
so to gain an end in mind to your coding assignment, thus I won't be liable for any plagiarism consequences.
